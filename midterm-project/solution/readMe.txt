HERE IS THE DEMO LINK: https://youtu.be/EBpStBJIdgU


I tried and run the program (part3) on this Ubuntu32 bit machine. 
It works properly, but for some reason it works very slowly (too slow).
I think this slowness is due to the specs of my physical machine, though I'm not sure.

But in the demo I shared, I show that the program is working properly. 
If you couldn't tested it, I ask you for a demo. thank you.

The source files must be compiled with -std=c++11 switch. I already prepared a makefile
for them, you can compile it by typing "make" directly.

Don't bother the warning from "make" command. It's because of the virtual machine's wrong time.
