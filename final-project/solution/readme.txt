just type "make".

note 1: while finding the optimal size, it's taking too much time with the current parameters: Physical memory holding 16K integers and the virtual memory holding 128K integers. Yet, I left as it is. But I recommended to change that constant "13" to at least "8" in the line 468 of "paging-simulation.h" for reasonable amount of time. 

note: just to create a single executable and maintain simplicity, I did not prepare a separate executable for additional programs mentioned in part3. as you can see from the comments in the "program.cpp" file, it will be enough to uncomment you to run those programs. But in any case, don't forget to feed the program with the argument list.

thank you.
